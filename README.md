# Improving Walking Accuracy Project

A key focus of our mapping initiative is the creation and refinement of walking lines and sidewalks across the United States. By enriching this data, we aim to support better pedestrian navigation and accessibility. Our dedicated team—based in India and California—will be actively contributing to OSM by:

  1. Creating and updating walking paths and sidewalks to enhance walkability.
  2. Mapping indoor airport features such as terminals, entrances, security checks, elevators, and escalators for improved indoor navigation.
  3. Collaborating with local operations teams
  4. Ensuring all edits comply with OSM’s Organized Editing Best Practices.


These efforts directly support Uber’s goal of providing seamless and accurate trip experiences for all users, particularly in urban environments where pedestrian infrastructure is essential.
